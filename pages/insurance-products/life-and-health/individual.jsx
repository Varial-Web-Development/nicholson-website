          <h2>Health Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            With Health Insurance now required in the state of Washington, many people are looking for coverage for themselves and their families. If your employer doesn't provide medical benefits, you may feel overwhelmed by the potential costs and limitations. At Nicholson & Associates, we have a range of individual Health Insurance options so you can secure the benefits that meet your needs. We can evaluate your budget and health needs to make sure we find the best policy for you. Our team knows the ins and outs of complex topics like deductibles, co-pays, and network limitations so you can better understand your options and pick the plan that best suits you. 
          </p>
          <p>
            With any Health Insurance plan, you will want to think about how much money you want to have to spend out of pocket. There is a fine balance between an affordable monthly Health Insurance plan and a high deductible. While it may be tempting to save on the monthly cost and opt for a high deductible, this can be challenging in practice if you aren't able to meet your deductible based on the care you need. We can help you navigate this balancing act to figure out what an affordable out-of-pocket cost is and what fits within your monthly budget. This way, you can save on your premiums without buying a Health Insurance plan that you never actually get to use. Additionally, you will want to consider any copays or coinsurance to make sure that you don't price yourself out of your own plan when it comes to paying for medications or seeking specialized care.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important consideration for picking the right Health Insurance plan is your current health situation. If you take prescription medications or are managing a chronic health condition, it will be important to find a plan that covers as much of these expenses as possible. Health Insurance plans vary when it comes to covered medications and specialists. Brand-name prescriptions versus generic drugs can be covered very differently depending on the plan you choose, so if you have become accustomed to a certain medication, you will want to make sure it is included in your plan. It is also important to think about any specialists you currently see on a regular basis, or specialized care you anticipate needing in the future. Coinsurance can vary depending on the type of treatment, so it is best to review Health Insurance plans carefully for these distinctions to make sure you don't end up with a plan that requires huge out-of-pocket expenses for specialty care.

            Fitting all of these things into a Health Insurance plan can be complicated, which is why we are here to help. Contact us today to speak with a health insurance agent and find the right Health Insurance plan for you.

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Health Savings Account</h2>
          <p>
            For some people, Health Insurance with a lower deductible simply won't fit within their budget. There is still hope for anyone stuck in this scenario. Health Savings Accounts are a great option that can be used in conjunction with high-deductible health insurance policies. With a Health Savings Account, you can put away pre-tax funds that can be applied toward an eligible medical expense, including an associated deductible, copay, or coinsurance.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the perks of a Health Savings Account is that the funds typically can roll over year to year. This can largely lower your overall healthcare costs by allowing you to stockpile funds for future medical expenses, which can often be for emergency care or routine health services. These funds never expire and may be applicable toward medical expenses for your spouse or dependents, depending on your plan. The money cannot be used to pay your monthly Health Insurance premiums, but this small drawback is well worth the benefits and perks you can experience with a Health Savings Account.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on your circumstances, a Health Savings Account may be just the thing for you and your family to pay for essential health services. Contact us today to speak with a licensed health insurance agent and learn how this coverage can make paying for medical expenses a breeze.

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Dental Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            Most days, we only think about our teeth for a few minutes when we brush them and then move right on with the next thing. But if dental problems crop up and you need care, you may not be prepared to pay for treatment, surgeries, or even cleanings out of pocket. Dental Insurance is an affordable way to cover routine and unexpected dental procedures to keep your teeth healthy and prevent long-term conditions from worsening.
          </p>
          <p>
            We offer a variety of Dental plans so you can find the right fit for you. Most plans will cover anywhere from 50% to 80% of procedural costs such as wisdom teeth extractions, root canals, and crowns, and some plans will even fully cover those annual check-ups and cleanings. If you are looking for a way to cut down on regular out-of-pocket costs, Dental Insurance has you covered with one simple and comprehensive plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dental Insurance provides options to take care of your teeth and gums whenever you need to. Contact us today to speak with a licensed health insurance agent to discover how Dental Insurance can take the worry out of your teeth care.

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Medicare Supplement Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            As you near retirement age, you are likely preparing for the switch from your current health insurance plan to Medicare. Oftentimes this transition can be quite the process, and you want to make sure you are never left without the proper coverage when you finally secure your Medicare plan. With Medicare Supplement Insurance, you can fill the gaps between your old Health Insurance plan and your new Medicare coverage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Medicare is extremely complex and has many parts that cover specific medical expenses. Medicare Supplements align with these parts by providing coverage where Medicare cannot be billed directly. There are 12 different parts within Medicare, and trying to understand the intricacies of each part can be extremely time-consuming and confusing. Our team of insurance professionals is well-versed and experienced in these in-depth sections, so you can rest assured that you have the guidance you need to determine where you need additional coverage with Medicare Supplement Insurance.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're preparing to move to Medicare, we are here to provide support to make sure you don't have any unexpected gaps in your coverage. Contact us today to speak with a licensed health insurance agent and get the right Medicare Supplement to couple with your Medicare plan.

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Short-Term Medical Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            With economic fluctuations, many of us have experienced downturns that have left us jobless or without benefits. It can be nerve-racking to live without Health Insurance considering the rising rate of car accidents and hazards present in our daily lives. Short-Term Medical Insurance bridges the gap between loss of your old Health Insurance policy and open enrollment so you can continue to have the coverage you need for any emergency medical care you might need.
          </p>
          <p>
            Short-Term Medical Insurance is quite unique and is designed specifically for unexpected health changes and emergency medical expenses. If you are currently managing a chronic health condition, you unfortunately may not be eligible for this health plan since pre-existing conditions are often excluded. It is still worth exploring this option to make sure you don't skip over potential coverage based on an assumption that you won't qualify.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many twists and turns in life that may leave you uninsured, and Short-Term Medical Insurance is available to cover you if you fall victim to these circumstances. The most common reasons for acquiring Short-Term Medical Insurance are loss of coverage through work, changing jobs, attending an out-of-state college, and waiting for open enrollment to begin. This temporary coverage can provide peace of mind during the interim before open enrollment starts or your new workplace benefits begin.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are experiencing a loss of Health Insurance benefits, you are not alone. Contact us today to speak with a licensed health insurance agent and find the right Short-Term Medical Insurance to bridge this gap.

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Disability Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            Disabilities can happen for a variety of reasons. A serious accident could result in a lifelong injury, or a chronic disease could cause deterioration over time. Either way, becoming disabled is a stressful and emotional experience that becomes even more challenging when you consider how you will survive financially. Disabilities can often severely impact a person's ability to work and can potentially affect daily living activities. This can mean a loss of income as well as additional expenses to get the care you need.
          </p>
          <p>
            It can be overwhelming to think about the potential hardship you would experience if you developed a disability or experienced a life-changing accident that left you permanently impacted. We provide solutions to this concern by offering Disability Insurance, which covers partial income so you can continue to pay your bills and live comfortably as you manage your new way of life. This coverage is especially important for people on a fixed income who may not have savings, retirement funds, pensions, or investments to keep them financially solvent in the face of disability. If you rely on your regular monthly income to make ends meet, Disability Insurance is an essential and affordable way to safeguard your livelihood in the event you become too sick to work or are permanently injured.
          </p>
          <p>
            People with disabilities still live full and happy lives, and with Disability Insurance, you can ensure that your financial situation doesn't weigh you down. Contact us today to speak with one of our licensed agents to learn more about how Disability Insurance can protect your future.

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Life Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            While many of us are choosing lifestyle habits to live a long and healthy life, there is still always the risk of an unexpected circumstance that cuts this dream short. It is never pleasant to think about our time coming to an end, but the reality is that this life has a beginning and an end no matter how we choose to live it. We are proud to provide a variety of Life Insurance options for individuals that want to plan ahead and make sure that their family is fully protected when the time comes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though you buy Life Insurance for yourself, it is important to remember that the coverage isn't really for you. The death benefit is intended for those you leave behind. You care deeply for your family and certainly don't want to leave your loved ones with a financial burden during their time of grief. Life Insurance provides a payout to whoever you designate as a beneficiary so that they can maintain their standard of living even after you are gone. The most common beneficiaries are spouses and children, though you can choose anyone you wish who would be affected financially by your passing.
          </p>
          <p>
            When determining an appropriate amount for Life Insurance, it is important to consider the here and now rather than your ideal time of passing. Our life insurance agents take you through a step-by-step process to understand the potential expenses and debts you may leave behind to your loved ones so you can secure an appropriate amount of coverage. Common expenses to consider include home mortgages, personal auto loans, and student debt, amongst other things such as recreational vehicle loans, business operating expenses, and medical bills. By carrying Life Insurance, you can ensure that any unpaid debts you leave behind can be paid for and lessen the financial impact on your family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important consideration is your current or potential income, since this revenue will be lost upon your passing. Even if your family could be financially secure without your income, it is still worth considering having enough to cover a year's salary so your family can take time off from work themselves to grieve your loss. Fatal accidents and injuries or rapid terminal illness aren't necessarily commonplace, but they are still a real-world risk. These tragic situations can be devastating for family members, and they may wish to take time off from work to mourn and heal from the loss. When making your life insurance decisions, it is worth taking the time to think about the practical and emotional repercussions of your passing and determine how you want your family to be taken care of during that time.
