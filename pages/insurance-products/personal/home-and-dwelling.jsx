          <h2>Homeowner's Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            Owning a home is a huge milestone for many people. It is the cultivation of years of 
            hard work and dedication, and is something to be truly proud of. This accomplishment 
            should never be at risk due to unforeseen circumstances and your investment should 
            always be protected. Homeowners insurance is a comprehensive policy that covers a 
            range of potential risks that could threaten the safety, security, and livability of 
            your home. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally called fire insurance, the purpose of Homeowners Insurance is to protect 
            against natural risks such as wildfires or storms. In the event of a loss, Homeowners 
            insurance covers the cost to rebuild and replace tangible things, including your 
            personal property, separate structures, and the dwelling itself. An important 
            distinction to make with any home insurance policy is prolonged losses versus sudden 
            losses. Insurance is intended for sudden, unforeseen, and accidental occurrences, and 
            does not cover things that happen over time. It may feel like insurance should cover 
            mold growth, pest infestations, or rotting wood, but these things are simply part of 
            the normal wear and tear of a home that can be reduced and resolved with proper care 
            and maintenance. Understanding this difference can really help homeowners better 
            prepare for potential risks, covered and not covered. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It is impossible to truly prepare financially for an unexpected loss on your own. What 
            would you do if your house burned down tomorrow? Are you confident you have the right 
            coverage to rebuild from the ground up? This can be a very scary situation for people 
            that are underinsured, and our personal insurance team is here to help make sure your 
            home is properly protected. Our licensed insurance agents work collaboratively with 
            each homeowner to make sure that every nook and cranny is accounted for so you can feel 
            confident that even in the worst-case situation, you can take care of your family and 
            rebuild the home you love.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your home is where you build memories, start a family, and create a life for yourself 
            and those you love. We are here to help protect what you have worked so hard to build.

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Manufactured Home Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            For some aspiring homeowners, a manufactured home is an affordable and flexible option 
            that provides the freedom to set down roots anywhere. Manufactured homes offer 
            simplicity in modern living that allows individuals to seamlessly achieve their dream 
            of homeownership. At Nicholson & Associates, we understand the risks present for 
            manufactured homes and have special policies designed to protect your new forever home. 
          </p>
          <p>
            When it comes to covering your manufactured home, there is little difference in the 
            actual coverage on the insurance policy compared to a homeowners insurance policy. 
            Manufactured Home Insurance comes with the same essential coverage options, including 
            the dwelling, separate structures, personal property, and liability. Despite the 
            similarities, a manufactured home cannot be covered with a standard Home Insurance 
            policy. This is because the potential risks are greater for manufactured homes, and 
            therefore come with their own set of parameters and costs to properly cover the 
            structure. On average, manufactured homes are more susceptible to natural disasters 
            because of the way they are constructed, which may mean greater losses in the end. 
            This doesn't mean your insurance costs are guaranteed to be through the roof. With our
             licensed agents and numerous insurance carriers, we can find the right policy for you 
             at a price that works for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you're in the market for a manufactured home, we are here to help provide you with 
            the insight and knowledge you need to make the best decision for you and your family. 
            Contact us today to work with one of our licensed personal lines agents and see how 
            Manufactured Home Insurance can easily fit into your budget.

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Condo Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            As a condo owner, you have made your home in a community that suits your unique needs. 
            Your condo insurance policy should be tailored to do the same. Our licensed personal 
            lines agents understand the nuances of Condo Insurance and are well-versed in common 
            requirements of the Condo Association. By working with a Nicholson agent, you can make 
            sure you are meeting the community's expectations while simultaneously protecting your 
            investment and property. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Like home insurance, Condo Insurance is designed to protect what you own and cover your 
            liability. Unlike houses, though, the building containing the condos themselves is 
            often owned and managed by a Condo Association. This makes your risk a little different 
            because you are not financially responsible for rebuilding the condo if it is 
            completely destroyed. You are, however, responsible for replacing the “walls in,” 
            meaning any fixtures, cabinetry, countertops, and appliances. To properly cover these 
            things, a Reconstruction Cost Estimate can be done with our licensed agents to 
            determine how much coverage you need. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In the event of a total loss, you never want to be left with gaps in coverage. With our 
            condo insurance policies, you can ensure that you have everything covered for yourself 
            and your Condo Association. Contact our team to speak with a licensed personal lines 
            agent and learn more about how Condo Insurance can protect you. 
          </p>

        <section className="section-alt flex flex-col gap-8 items-center">
          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Renters Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            One of the biggest perks of renting is that you are not responsible for the home 
            itself. While owning a home is a wonderful goal, it does come with some maintenance 
            obligations that can be quite costly. As a tenant, you never have to worry about a 
            surprise bill for a broken water heater or having to save up to replace the roof. 
            Although these concerns aren't present for renters, tenants still have potential risks 
            they need to protect themselves against. 
          </p>
          <p>
            In most rental situations, you are responsible for purchasing all of your own furniture 
            and possibly even the appliances. If the home or apartment burns down, the owner will 
            use their insurance to rebuild the structure, but this doesn't cover any of your 
            personal belongings. Having a renters policy allows you to protect all of your personal 
            property so that you don't have to foot a costly and unexpected bill in the event of a 
            loss. Additionally, you have coverage to secure another rental in the event your current 
            home becomes unlivable after a loss, which can save a great deal of money and heartache.
          </p>
          <p>
            Renters still face the same potential risk that every homeowner does: negligence. If an 
            action causes damage or harm to someone else, then this could fall back on you with 
            serious consequences. Even without owning a home, you still have assets and income to 
            protect in the event you are deemed liable for injury or damage to others and should 
            never risk these being liquidated in a lawsuit.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a renter, you are living in a home that someone else owns and has a financial 
            interest in and responsibility to protect. If you accidentally cause damage to their 
            property, the owner will likely hold you financially responsible even if they have 
            insurance to cover it. This can make for a costly and potentially life-changing mistake 
            depending on the severity of the damage. By carrying liability insurance, you can 
            protect their interest and yours simultaneously. Many landlords require a Renters 
            Insurance policy from their tenants and may even request a minimum liability limit to 
            safeguard their investment against accidental damages. Though it is always best to be 
            a considerate tenant and take good care of the home, accidents happen, and when they do, 
            you want to be properly covered.

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Dwelling Fire Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            As a landlord, you have a vested interest in the properties you own and rent to others. 
            Not only is the home an investment, it is a source of income for you and your family. 
            Potential risks should never threaten your livelihood, which is where a Dwelling Fire 
            Insurance policy can make all the difference. Whether your home is rented, unoccupied, 
            or vacant, Nicholson & Associates has options to fit your every need and protect your 
            property.
          </p>
          <p>
            The primary purpose of Dwelling Fire Insurance is to cover just that: the dwelling. 
            Since you do not live in the home yourself, you do not have a need to cover personal 
            property or additional living expenses. The main concern is ensuring that the 
            structures themselves are covered in the event of a loss. In the eyes of insurance 
            carriers, the level of risk is different depending on the occupancy status. Our 
            licensed personal lines agents fully understand the ins and outs of these differences 
            and can help you find the best policy to cover your current situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, liability coverage is often included or available to add with a Dwelling 
            Fire Insurance policy. Even though you aren't actively living on the property, there 
            are still potential hazards and risks that could be tied to you. In the event someone 
            is hurt on the property, you could be considered negligent and deemed responsible for 
            covering their medical bills, even if they were never supposed to be on the property in 
            the first place. It is important to do your best to minimize these risks as much as 
            possible by taking precautionary measures such as adequate fencing, security cameras, 
            and functioning locks. Unfortunately, there is a limit to what can be done to mitigate 
            risk, which is why opting for higher liability limits on a Dwelling Fire policy is 
            always a good idea.
          </p>
          <p>
            For your additional properties, you want to make sure they are protected at the same 
            caliber as your own home. Contact us today to speak with a licensed personal lines 
            agent and learn more about how a Dwelling Fire policy can protect against unforeseen 
            risks.

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Key Coverages</h2>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-3xl">Dwelling</h3>
            <p>
              The crux of any dwelling policy, this coverage covers the expense to repair or reconstruct a dwelling in the event it is damaged or destroyed in a covered loss. It is the foundation of many different home policies and is often protected on an exclusionary basis, meaning all perils are covered except those explicitly excluded on the policy. Limits are determined by conducting a Reconstruction Cost Estimate, which uses data such as square footage, bathrooms, and interior and exterior materials.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-3xl">Separate Structures</h3>
            <p>
              Many properties come with separate buildings, and this coverage is designed to repair or rebuild them in the event of a covered loss. This can range from small tool sheds to large detached garages. This limit is often 10% of the dwelling amount, though it can and should be adjusted for more costly separate structures. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-3xl">Personal Property</h3>
            <p>
              Over the years, you have likely accumulated many items, some of which you are surprised to discover still tucked away in the basement. Also called contents coverage, this coverage pays to replace any covered belongings damaged or destroyed in a covered loss, such as a fire. Each item in our homes may seem inexpensive or easy to replace on its own, but when you put it all together, it can add up to quite a bit. Personal property coverage ensures that everything in your home can be replaced so you don't have to start from square one. This is often 75% of the dwelling limit, but can be set higher if needed.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-3xl">Personal Article Floater</h3>
            <p>
              Some items may be quite valuable or perhaps irreplaceable, which is where a Personal Article Floater comes in. This coverage allows you to insure precious items to their original or market value in the event they are damaged, destroyed, or stolen. Often, this coverage is used for wedding rings or other expensive jewelry, fine art, firearms, and even collectibles. These items are covered only up to a certain limit on a standard dwelling policy, so it is important to evaluate your belongings to make sure you aren't left with a gap. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-3xl">Liability</h3>
            <p>
              In the event you are deemed responsible for someone else's property damage or injuries, Liability coverage is available to cover the costs. On a home policy, this coverage is quite broad and can cover incidents that happen away from your property, such as your dog getting loose and attacking someone down the street. With Liability coverage, you can ensure you, your family, and your assets are protected in the event of negligence.  
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-3xl">Additional Living Expenses</h3>
            <p>
              It is important to consider where you will stay while your home is being rebuilt or repaired. This coverage pays for the cost to lease a short-term rental or stay in a hotel in the event your home is unlivable after a covered loss. It will even cover added costs due to the relocation, such as gas for a longer commute. For most people, uprooting their life and family to a temporary living situation is stressful and can be quite costly. This coverage takes a great financial pressure off of you so you can focus on your normal routine.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-3xl">Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value</h3>
            <p>
              Every policy is designed to offer coverage to rebuild your home, repair damaged structures, and replace your Personal Property. With Replacement Cost, your home and structures are covered based on the actual cost to rebuild, and any lost belongings will be replaced to value, minus your deductible. Actual Cash Value accounts for depreciation, so the payout is based on the actual current value of the dwelling, structures, or items you have. We highly recommend that homeowners opt for Replacement Cost whenever possible so that they can recover without having to worry about depreciation. With Replacement Cost, you can rest easy knowing your home and structures will be rebuilt fully and that your lost belongings will be replaced to value.
