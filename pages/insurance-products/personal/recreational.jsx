            The best things in life are the ones that create long-lasting memories. Cross-country roadtrips in the RV, early morning motorcycle rides through the mountains, and summertime getaways on the lakeboat all bring joyful experiences that will stand the tests of time. Enjoying these precious moments still comes with some risk and uncertainty, but this doesn't mean they have to come to an end. With adequate insurance coverage, you can let the good times roll no matter what happens.

          <h2>Boat Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            Most boats come with a serious level of investment and commitment to keep them running smoothly. As a proud boat owner, you likely spend many weekends performing cleaning and routine maintenance to ensure those coastal voyages go off without a hitch. With Boat Insurance, you can easily protect this investment of time and money and cover yourself in the event of an accident. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Boat Insurance is a broad category for a variety of vessels. From sailboats and speedboats to yachts and catamarans, there is a policy out there to cover your watercraft's unique specifications. Every boat also comes with its own set of risks and considerations depending on how and where it is used and stored. With Pacific Northwest weather, many boat owners and enthusiasts may be inclined to lay-up their hull until the summer season comes back around. Many policies offer a savings for storage months when the watercraft isn't being actively used.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not only does Boat Insurance cover physical damage to your watercraft, it also protects against damages caused to others. Boat Insurance often comes with the option to add Liability coverage. Although boat collisions may not be common, this coverage is still important to carry in the event the unexpected happens. Additionally, Liability doesn't just cover damage to other watercrafts; it also can cover damage caused to government or private property such as docks or piers, which could accidentally be damaged when returning from a day out on the water. In any event, it is always better to be prepared for the worst than risk being on the hook for these costs.
          </p>
          <p>
            With so many types of watercrafts, we know that a one-size-fits-all approach just won't cut it. Contact us today to speak with a licensed personal lines agent and learn how we can tailor a Boat Insurance policy just for you.

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Motorcycle Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            For motorcycle riders, there is nothing quite like the open road. The freedom to explore the world around you and escape everyday life shouldn't be weighed down with worries of what-ifs. With motorcycle insurance, you can have peace of mind knowing you are properly covered no matter what. At Nicholson & Associates, we have a range of options to keep you properly protected out there on your travels.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2021, Motorcycle Insurance became mandatory in the state of Washington. Many people may feel this was an unnecessary requirement because of the perceived damage potential of a motorcycle. However, the reality is that while a motorcycle isn't as destructive as a car, it can still cause damage or injury to others. Rather than taking this risk, opt for Motorcycle Insurance and avoid state fines while properly protecting yourself and those around you in the event of an accident.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond liability, Motorcycle Insurance also provides coverage for damages to the bike itself. Depending on the motorcycle, you may have put a lot of time, money, and energy into getting it running just how you like it, and an accident shouldn't undo all of that hard work. With this protection, you can easily repair or replace your motorcycle in the event of a wreck, or even theft or vandalism. No matter where you go, you will have the right coverage to keep riding easy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Motorcycle riders are unfortunately the most vulnerable drivers on the road. Even with protective gear, a collision with a car or object can be very serious. Motorcycle policies offer medical coverage through Personal Injury Protection, which can cover your medical expenses even if you are at fault for the accident. Having this additional coverage can make a huge difference if you become injured while on your motorcycle.
          </p>

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Recreational Vehicle Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            When it comes to experiencing a new destination, nothing beats a road trip in your own RV or camper. Traveling becomes seamless in your home away from home as you venture to faraway places, or even just your favorite spots in your own backyard. Wherever you decide to go, we understand how important it is to safeguard this special investment, which is why we offer insurance for recreational vehicles of all shapes and sizes.
          </p>
          <p>
            From motor homes to travel trailers, recreational vehicles bring ease with travel, and your insurance should provide the same seamless experience. Recreational Vehicle Insurance provides coverage for your investment in the event it is damaged or destroyed while out on the road. While auto insurance can extend coverage to a travel trailer, this is exclusively for when it is attached to your vehicle. Once you reach the campsite, this coverage is no longer applicable, leaving you with a huge gap. A separate Recreational Vehicle Insurance policy is highly recommended to make sure your trailer is fully covered not only against damage, but also for liability reasons. If someone is hurt because of negligence on the campsite, this would fall under Liability coverage on the RV policy to properly protect your interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like an Auto policy, there are optional coverages available including Roadside Assistance and Emergency Assistance. While you may feel comfortable changing a tire on your sedan, performing any kind of maintenance on an RV or motorhome may be daunting or just plain impossible. With this additional protection, you can quickly get the emergency service you need so you can get back on the road in no time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep the fun rolling with the right coverage for you. Contact us today to speak with one of our licensed personal lines agents and discover how RV Insurance can keep you protected on your next adventure.

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">ATV Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            Experiencing nature has never been so fun as it is on an ATV. The thrill of the speed and the unlimited off-roading potential come together to make for an exciting adventure anywhere. But like any vehicle, these rugged quads come with their own risks that every operator should consider. Although the danger may be part of the fun for some people, being prepared for an accident with ATV Insurance will give you the freedom to focus on the ride and not the risk.
          </p>
          <p>
            ATV Insurance offers very similar coverage found on an Auto policy, meaning you can protect the vehicle, liability, and medical expenses all in one place. Carrying this protection can fill in any gaps you may have when it comes to replacing your ATV or paying for medical bills in the event of an accident. Additionally, ATV Insurance provides coverage for theft on and away from your property so you can get reimbursed and buy a replacement without skipping a beat. Though rare, collisions on an ATV are not impossible and any damages or injuries to others should never be paid for with your personal bank account. By opting for an ATV policy, you can cover a wide range of risks and ride worry-free. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Get the right protection tailored for your needs. Contact us today to speak with one of our licensed personal lines agents and learn more about how ATV Insurance can cover you.

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Snowmobile Insurance</h2>
          <p>
            One silver lining to the long Washington winters is the ever-present snow in many of the surrounding mountainous areas. With the mild climate and cold conditions, there are so many places that are perfect for snowmobiling. Like any vehicle, properly protecting your investment and liability is always a good idea, and we have the knowledge and options to help you find the best coverage for your snowmobile. 
          </p>
          <p>
            While many states do not require Snowmobile Insurance, it is still recommended in the event of an accident. Snowmobiles are capable of high speeds, which in a collision can result in damages and injuries to yourself and even to others. Rather than risking a financial burden on yourself, you can obtain snowmobile insurance to keep yourself protected even in the worst situations. Additionally, you can opt for coverage against physical damage caused by external forces so that if something happens to it while it is sitting, you can easily replace it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prepare yourself for potential risks out in the snow. Contact us today to speak with one of our licensed personal lines agents and see how Snowmobile Insurance can cover your next winter excursion.

          <h2 className="max-w-[20ch] leading-tight text-center">Key Coverages</h2>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-3xl">Comprehensive & Collision</h3>
            <p>
              These two coverages often go hand in hand since they both protect physical damages to your vehicle. So what's the difference? Comprehensive covers damages caused by things other than a collision, such as a tree branch falling on your motorcycle or ATV. Collision coverage, on the other hand, strictly covers damages to your car caused by you colliding with another object, be that another car, the garage door, or a telephone pole. Both come with a deductible of your choice that you pay out of pocket in the event you file a claim to cover the cost of repairs.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-3xl">Towing</h3>
            <p>
              If you happen to get stranded on the side of the road while out on a motorcycle ride or cruising in your RV, you want to have a way to get home. This coverage will pay for the expense to tow your recreational vehicle either to the nearest repair shop or to your home. It usually comes with a mileage limit, so be sure to verify how far your coverage will take you.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-3xl">Custom Equipment</h3>
            <p>
              Motorcycles, boats, ATVs, and all the other fun toys often have special options that you can customize either with the manufacturer or on your own. This coverage protects custom equipment installed on a recreational vehicle so that you are reimbursed for loss to additional on your motorcycle, boat, and more.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3 className="text-lg lg:text-3xl">Liability</h3>
            <p>
              Even while out enjoying the day, accidents can happen. This coverage ensures you have coverage for negligent acts in case you accidentally cause damage or injury to others. Liability protection is essential for ATVs, boats, motorcycles, and RVs since operation comes with risk of minor to major accidents.
